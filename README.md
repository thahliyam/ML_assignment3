# ML_assignment3
This project focuses on implementing and evaluating different regression techniques using the California Housing dataset from the sklearn library. The primary objective is to predict housing prices based on various features such as population, median income, and location-related attributes. The assignment involves data preprocessing, where the dataset is cleaned, checked for missing values, and standardized to ensure optimal model performance. Several regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor (SVR), are implemented and compared based on their accuracy and efficiency. The performance of each model is assessed using key evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared Score (RÂ²). Through this comparative analysis, the best-performing and least-effective models are identified, providing insights into the effectiveness of different regression techniques for predicting real-world housing prices. This project demonstrates the importance of selecting the right regression model based on dataset characteristics and the impact of preprocessing on model accuracy.
